Last <time datetime="2012-04-22">Sunday</time> i set out to tackle an
issue i had. The issue was that i didn’t really know how to design with
fluid grids in a good way. Every since i started designing in a
responsive manner, i had almost abandoned grids completely, but
sometimes there where a need for order but i didn’t have a tool that
could help me out.

Previously i used [\#grid](http://hashgrid.com), by the folks at
[Analog](http://analog.coop), to make sure my design followed the grid,
but then responsive web design and fluid grids came along, and it didn’t
work out anymore. I needed something that was more suitable toward
responsive designs. This is my attempt. A first step.

My goal was to get something out there as quickly as possible, and worry
about optimization and performance later. All in all i spent about a
week to get to where i am now, i designed the grid layout and some basic
script functionality the first day. Following days was spent on code for
generating a baseline grid and columns.
