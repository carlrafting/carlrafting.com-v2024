Today marks the seventh version of carlrafting.com. It has been a long
time in the making. Kinda hard to tell by looking around here. But as
always when you’re designing and developing your own personal
website/blog, it’s harder than doing it for clients or other projects.
It’s always more to think about than you first realize. At least it was
for me.

I wanted to fresh things up a bit. The previous was really quite
outdated. It started out as a fixed-width pixel based design. Then later
on i made the necessary adjustments to make it more responsive. Note
that is say *more responsive* and not *truly responsive*, because it
just wasn’t. And lets face it, the 14px font-size on the text content
wasn’t that easy to read.

This time around i’ve retired my old friend
[TextPattern](http://textpattern.com) and moved on to
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I’ve grown alot as a developer the last
few years and Jekyll suits my workflow better these days. I was getting
quite hindered by TextPatterns template system and the fact that i had
to keep the local database and live database in sync whenever i wanted
to make changes. In that regard Jekyll is perfect. It’s just static
files.
