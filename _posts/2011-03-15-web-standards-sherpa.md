An excerpt from the [about page](http://webstandardssherpa.com/about),
explaining what the goal of the site is:

> The goal of WebStandardsSherpa.com is to provide web professionals the
> opportunity to receive feedback, glean advice and learn best practices
> from experts in the field to help them improve the quality of their
> own work.

Web Standards Sherpa is a project from [The Web Standards
Project](http://www.webstandards.org/). Aaron Gustafson explains a bit
about the project [in this blog
post](http://www.webstandards.org/2011/03/13/the-sherpas-are-here/).

> Web Standards Sherpa came about because we wanted to create a
> repository of best practices information while, at the same time,
> providing mentorship opportunities for practicing web professionals.

Dan Cederholm, Founder and Principal of
[SimpleBits](http://simplebits.com/), handled the initial design and art
direction of the project which he talks about [in a blog post on his
site](http://simplebits.com/notebook/2011/03/14/webstandardssherpa/).
