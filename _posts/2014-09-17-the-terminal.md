As a web developer i spend quite a lot of time working on the
command-line, or more specifically Mac OS Xâ€™s Terminal. Craig (CHOCK!)
Hockenberry has compiled a *huge ass post* with lots of useful tips &
tricks for how to be a bit more productive when working in Terminal.
Some stuff are already familiar to me, but i actually learned some new
things by reading this post. Maybe you can too?
