If you’re doing web development, [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com) is
probably no stranger to you. [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/)
recently did an interview with him. I really enjoyed his view on
writing, as it’s something i’m struggling with. On the other hand,
writing is something that i also find very rewarding.

> The ability to express yourself, as a designer, is hugely important:
> There was a post from 37Signals a few years back, about how, when they
> were hiring, they looked for people who could write, because it’s a
> form of communication, and design is a lot about communication. So
> yeah, write. For its own sake, without expecting to get anything back.
> If you expect to get something back, you’ll only be disappointed when
> it doesn’t happen, and you’ll kinda self-censor yourself.
