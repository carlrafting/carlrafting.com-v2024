Ethan Marcotte’s long awaited [book about responsive web
design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) is
finally here. To get a sense of what responsive web design is all about,
you should [check out the
article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/)
Ethan wrote on the subject over at A List Apart.

Ethan describes a bit what the book is a about [in a blog
post](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/a-book-called-responsive-web-design/).

> So what’s the book about and stuff I guess,” you ask. Well, Responsive
> Web Design expands on the ideas I articulated in the original article.
> It’s a crash course in how you can apply fluid grids, flexible images,
> and media queries to your own work, but let’s face it: design is so
> much more than those three ingredients. As a result, I’ve tried to
> share a few stories I’ve picked up from working on real, live
> responsive projects: the lessons I’ve learned, the questions that have
> been raised, the hard choices made. The result is a beautifully
> designed little book (take a bow, Jason) that contains everything you
> need to start exploring a more flexible, more responsive approach to
> designing for the web. And at 150 pages, it won’t overstay its
> welcome.

The book was [released two days
ago](https://twitter.com/#!/beep/status/78069978355597312) and Roger
Johansson has already [written a review on the
book](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201106/responsive_web_design_book_review/),
and there’s a portion of chapter 3, called [Fluid
Images](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluid-images/), posted at A
List Apart as well.

Here’s what Roger has to say about the book:

> I remember thinking “Ah, yes, this is the right way forward” after
> reading Jeffrey Zeldman’s article To Hell With Bad Browsers over ten
> years ago. Reading Responsive Web Design gives me that same feeling of
> wanting to apply what I’ve just read about right away. It could very
> well turn out to be a classic comparable to Jeffrey Zeldman’s
> Designing with Web Standards.

The [book is available over at A Book
Apart](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design), $18.00
for the paperback version and $9.00 for the ebook version, there’s a
$23.00 bundle as well.
