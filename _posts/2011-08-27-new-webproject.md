title: New webproject. A quick silly ~1 hour weekend project
---

This idea came to me when i thought to myself, what if i could just type
one command into the terminal, and the folders and documents i needed
where there? I immediately got to work and came up with this, it doesn’t
look much yet but it is indeed handy and i intend to expand it further
than this. Say, maybe get a bunch of files from github?

Okay let’s not get ahead of ourselves here, time will tell if i’ll
actually add this. Anyway… This isn’t a groundbreaking new project of
mine, it’s just a result of making reality of an idea i had, and it
worked. As simple as that.
