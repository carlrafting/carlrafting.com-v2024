Another year has passed, this one is shaping up to be a better one than
the previous. One thing that’s always on the top of my list, every year,
is that i would like to write more. For some reason, things are always
getting in the way and distracting me from writing. More importantly i
don’t really know what i *should write*, and when i’m finally sitting
down to write something, it’s a real struggle to write something i’m
somewhat satisfied with. I guess i’m [not alone in
this](http://adactio.com/journal/6632/).

At least i have a general idea of what i would like to write about this
year. I would like to write more about what i’ve learned and how i solve
problems, related to designing and developing for the web. That’s how i
learned when i got started. Something i find very valuable is when other
people write about how they approach certain problems or challanges.
That’s the great thing about the web, sharing. So i hope to do more of
that, writing and *sharing*.

I’d like to spend some time on
[autogrow](https://github.com/carlrafting/autogrow) and
[designgrid](https://github.com/carlrafting/designgrid), improve them a
bit. There’s some enhancements i have mind for designgrid, make the
script more customizable and squash some bugs. Try using designgrid
without a stylesheet and see how that goes… <small>(Hint: it might crash
your browser!)</small>. I also have an idea for a new project i like to
do as well.

Last year around this time, i spent about two and a half months helping
out the guys over at [Republic](http://republic.se). They recently
[launched the project i helped out
with](https://www.facebook.com/republicfactory/posts/10152046175545960).
I’m really grateful for spending the time at Republic since they’re hard
working and super busy guys. I did most of the initial development,
building the admin, calendar and the welcome areas. I got to learn a bit
about [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com), this was actually the first project i’ve
ever used Sass on, and i’ve come to use it ever since.

A lot of time the past year, has been devoted to studies. Now i only
have a few months left of my
[education](http://www.jenseneducation.se/JENSEN-yrkeshogskola/). One
more period, three months of internship left then i’m done with my
studies… For now. I’m hoping i can get back to working again. I’ve
learned a lot since last time when [i worked at
nodestar](http://nodestar.se), so there’s a lot more i can do now.
