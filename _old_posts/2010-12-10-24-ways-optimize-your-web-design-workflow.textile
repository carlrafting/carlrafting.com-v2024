I fully agree with Veerle, that it's necessary to use photoshop to able to achieve maximum creative freedom. It's something about working with markup and style that not always enable one to be fully creativeâ€¦ I should also mention that i really enjoy these kind of practical articles, they're really valuable in that you get the chance to see how other designers workflow looks like.

But then i also believe that it's easy to set the wrong expectations for clients, if you show them static comps, because these days there are more ways we can accomplish certain effects in CSS, and if we as web designers really want to take full advantage of the latest CSS and HTML technologies, then the best way is probably to show them CSS and HTML prototypes.

So i do believe a way to combine these workflows will benefit the project a lot.
