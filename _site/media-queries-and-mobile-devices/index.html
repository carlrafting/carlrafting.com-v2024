<h1>A note on media-queries and mobile devices</h1>

<p>These days, there is a lot of talk about reponsive design and mobile/content first. While i think we can agree on that these strategies isn&#8217;t entirely bulletproof (yet!), they have a ceratin appeal and can be fairly easy to implement and use today. I do believe that this approach is better than making a mobile version of a website, but that is probably necessary sometimes.</p>
<h2>The issue</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon an issue when i was working on a web-application the other day. I had just finished the design in photoshop and then i built the templates in html/css. I should point out that this was the <em>desktop</em> version of the design. Later on i wanted to make it look good on mobile devices as well, so i set up a media query in the stylesheet to cover the design changes for those kinds of devices.</p>
<p>The issue appeared to me at this stage of the process, the mobile devices would need to download the extra set of styles to reset the <em>desktop</em> styles. This is a bit of an issue, since when we talk about mobile, we asume that the device has significantly less bandwith than a desktop computer. That&#8217;s not necessarily true <strong>all</strong> the time but it <em>can</em> be most of the time, if one is on a bus-commute for example.</p>
<h2>Mobile-first</h2>
<p>So that is where mobile first comes in, the problem however has to do with when one would build templates from a photoshop design that covers the &#8220;desktop&#8221; version. It is a bit hard to develop with the mobile first approach in this case, since the templates has to match the original design as close as possible (That doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be pixel perfect or even look exactly the same in all browsers).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So i tought about this some more… And finally i came to the conclusion that the best way for me was to reset the desktop styles on mobile devices (and narrower viewports), since i wanted to keep them separate from each other (easier to maintain). This means however that mobile devices do indeed get a bit heavier stylesheet than what&#8217;s necessary, but on the other hand, there&#8217;s no extra http request needed. This certainly isn&#8217;t the most perfect solution, but at this stage in the development process it was the best way to do it.</p>
