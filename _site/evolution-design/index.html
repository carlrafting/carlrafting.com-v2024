<h1>The Evolution of a Design</h1>

<p>One of the things that makes designing for the web so appealing, is that it&#8217;s either cheap or even free to improve and iterate on a design over time, this is something that doesn&#8217;t work in, for example print (for obvious reasons). Unfortunatly this is something that doesn&#8217;t always happen when web designers work for clients, but on the other hand, changing a design too much would confuse potential customers. So what it comes down to is figuring out how much of the design <em>can</em> be improved upon.</p>
<p>In my case, i&#8217;ve done some iterations on an initial design of this site&#8217;s design, which&#8217;ve turned in to what you see now.</p>
<h2>Initial design concept</h2>
<div class="media-content"><a href="/images/9.png"><img src="/images/9t.png?1310831339" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>This is the first design concept i came up with. Initially i was going to use this for tumblr, but soon i turned back to TextPattern. It has no archive or about page and a small amount of visual elements.</p>
<h2>Current design concept</h2>
<div class="media-content"><a href="/images/8.png"><img src="/images/8t.png?1310831320" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Rather than starting from scratch i added to the already existing design, and you can see that it still shares some basic visual elements as typography and layout. Over time i made the layout responsive, added a navigation and made improvements to the archive page.</p>
<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>To me this is what makes designing for the web interesting but also challenging and it&#8217;s what sets the web apart from other mediums, the ability to constantly iterate and improve upon certain aspects of a website or applications design. This can be both good or bad , but fortunatley it&#8217;s easier to righten a misstake.</p>
