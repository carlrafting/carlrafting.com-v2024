<div class="post-excerpt">
<p>So here we are&#8230; Time for a redesign again. To be honest the last version was getting quite outdated (I mean 14px body text, even i cant read that!). It didn&#8217;t really reflect my current best practices and skillset, something that i was hoping to better display with a redesign (or perhaps realign is more fitting?).</p>

<div class="post-excerpt">
<p>Last week, <a href="http://carlrafting.com/designgrid-a-grid-tool-for-fluid-grids">about one week after i released designGrid</a>, i published yet another little project that i’ve been working on. This time i’m trying to solve the problem with textareas, or rather the frustration of using them, especially when you’re going to write a lot of text.</p>

<div class="post-excerpt">
<p>These days, there is a lot of talk about reponsive design and mobile/content first. While i think we can agree on that these strategies isn&#8217;t entirely bulletproof (yet!), they have a ceratin appeal and can be fairly easy to implement and use today.</p>

<div class="post-excerpt">
<p>This idea came to me when i thought to myself, what if i could just type one command into the terminal, and the folders and documents i needed where there? I immediately got to work and came up with this, it doesn&#8217;t look much yet but it is indeed handy and i intend to expand it further than this. Say, maybe get a bunch of files from github?</p>

<h2><a href="/evolution-design">The Evolution of a Design</a></h2>
<span class="posted"><time datetime="2011-07-26">Jul 26, 2011</time></span>

<div class="post-excerpt">
<p>One of the things that makes designing for the web so appealing, is that it&#8217;s either cheap or even free to improve and iterate on a design over time, this is something that doesn&#8217;t work in, for example print (for obvious reasons). Unfortunatly this is something that doesn&#8217;t always happen when web designers work for clients, but on the other hand, changing a design too much would confuse potential customers. So what it comes down to is figuring out how much of the design <em>can</em> be improved upon.</p>

<div class="link-description">
<p>Noah Stokes touches on a subject that is very common in the web community, the focus on why the tools are so great rather than the focus on solving the clients current issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML5. CSS3. Responsive Web Design. Sass. Less. Javascript Frameworks. No one cares about this stuff. Let me back up, the people who pay me money to build their sites/apps don’t care about this stuff. Why would they?</p>
