<h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>

<p>Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s long awaited <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">book about responsive web design</a> is finally here. To get a sense of what responsive web design is all about, you should <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">check out the article</a> Ethan wrote on the subject over at A List Apart.</p>
<p>Ethan describes a bit what the book is a about <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/a-book-called-responsive-web-design/">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what’s the book about and stuff I guess,” you ask. Well, Responsive Web Design expands on the ideas I articulated in the original article. It’s a crash course in how you can apply fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to your own work, but let’s face it: design is so much more than those three ingredients. As a result, I’ve tried to share a few stories I’ve picked up from working on real, live responsive projects: the lessons I’ve learned, the questions that have been raised, the hard choices made. The result is a beautifully designed little book (take a bow, Jason) that contains everything you need to start exploring a more flexible, more responsive approach to designing for the web. And at 150 pages, it won’t overstay its welcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book was <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/beep/status/78069978355597312">released two days ago</a> and Roger Johansson has already <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201106/responsive_web_design_book_review/">written a review on the book</a>, and there&#8217;s a portion of chapter 3, called <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluid-images/">Fluid Images</a>, posted at A List Apart as well.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Roger has to say about the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking “Ah, yes, this is the right way forward” after reading Jeffrey Zeldman’s article To Hell With Bad Browsers over ten years ago. Reading Responsive Web Design gives me that same feeling of wanting to apply what I’ve just read about right away. It could very well turn out to be a classic comparable to Jeffrey Zeldman’s Designing with Web Standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">book is available over at A Book Apart</a>, $18.00 for the paperback version and $9.00 for the ebook version, there&#8217;s a $23.00 bundle as well.</p>
