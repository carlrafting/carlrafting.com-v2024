<h1>designGrid — A grid-tool for fluid grids</h1>

<p><a href="/images/10.png"><img src="/images/10.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Last <time datetime="2012-04-22">Sunday</time> i set out to tackle an issue i had. The issue was that i didn’t really know how to design with fluid grids in a good way. Every since i started designing in a responsive manner, i had almost abandoned grids completely, but sometimes there where a need for order but i didn&#8217;t have a tool that could help me out.</p>
<p>Before i used <a href="http://hashgrid.com">#grid</a>, by the folks at <a href="http://analog.coop">Analog</a>, to make sure my design followed the grid, but then responsive web design and fluid grids came along, and it didn&#8217;t work out anymore. I needed something that was more suitable toward responsive designs. This is my attempt. A first step.</p>
<p>My goal was to get something out there as quickly as possible, and worry about optimization and performance later. All in all i spent about a week to get to where i am now, i  designed the grid layout and some basic script functionality the first day. Following days was spent on code for generating a baseline grid and columns.</p>
