h1. {{ page.title }}

p(lead). My name is Carl Räfting and i’m currently spending my time studying web application development at "Jensen Education YH":http://www.jenseneducation.se/JENSEN-yrkeshogskola/ in Gothenburg, Sweden.

h2. Computer Setup & Software

The computer of choice is a Apple 13" MacBook with the aluminum unibody, often used in clamshell mode attached to a 24" LED Cinema Display. Designing happens in Photoshop, markup and styles are written in "Espresso":http://macrabbit.com/espresso/.

h2. Web Technology

This site is HTML5 ready and uses some HTML5 attributes. The stylesheet uses some properties found in the CSS3 specification, which makes designing easier. This site runs on "Textpattern":http://textpattern.com, which does its job well.

h2. Typefaces

There are four different typfaces in use on this website. Headings are set in the beautiful Adelle Web served via Typekit. The body text is set in Georgia. Code samples are set in Anonymous Pro, also served via Typekit. Quotes are set in Baskerville italic.
